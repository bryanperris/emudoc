MMU Notes:
32bit addressing (4GB Max memory): virtual address space divided between kernel and user, 2 Gbytes for each
64bit addressing (1TB max memory): virtual address space is expanded to 1TB of user space

TLB Notes:
48 available entries
TLB Entry: maps a pair of varible-sized pages (4KB to 16MB) in multples of 4 (contains an odd and even memory page)
Each entry is tagged with the most-significent bits of virtual address, the number of these bits is based on page sized
TLB entries are access/mapped based on operating modes: kernel, user, and supervisor

Instruction TLB:
Invisible to software
2-entry TLB used to increase performence

Jumping: Computing the abolute address
Address = (Target << 2) | (32bit (PC >> 28) & 0xF or 64bit PC >> 60)
In J-type format, the 26-bit target address shifts left 2 bits and 
combines with the high-order 4 bits of the current program counter to form an absolute address.

Braching: Compute the adddress
Address = (delay slot address) + (((16 bit offset) << 2) -> 32 bit sign extended)
All branches occur with the delay of one instruction
branch delay slots are nullifed (bypassed) if a conditional branch is not 'likely' taken

All branch instruction target addresses are computed by adding theaddress of the instruction in the delay slot to the 16-bitoffset (shifted left2 bits and sign-extended to 32 bits).  All branches occur with a delay of oneinstruction.If a conditional branch likely is not taken, the instruction in the delay slotis nullified.

N64 PC/Addressing Note: We will use 64bit address, but process them as 32bit unsigned values

Secondary Cache
Uses direct mapping, addressed with the lower bits of the physical address

Cache Lines
Each cache has a its own 64-bit data line, and can be accessed in parallel
Access can happen twice a cycle
It is noted that the primary size ranges: 8KB to 32KB
Some CPU models offer connections to an external cache, with cache control/protection circults built in (don't think n64 uses this)

Load Delay Slots - When loading a value from memory to a register, the following instruction using the value must be scheduled on the load delay Slots
When the load is complete, the load delay slot is executed
Delayed load instructions do not allow its result to be used immediate by the next instruction, the delay slot, so if an instruction does, this causes
the interlock to add more clock cycles.

64-bit Operation for CPU
32-bit operands must be sign-extended (padding the new upper bits based on sign bit): 1000 0001 -> 1111 1111 1000 0001
Zero-Extension: When writing a 32bit value in a 64bit register, the upper unused bits are cleared

Pipeline / Timing
------------------
Pipeline has 8 stages, and runs twice the frequency of the master clock
Timing of instructions are determined by PCycles (Pipeline cycles)
Each instruction takes 8 cycles to complete
Branch delay time: 3 cycles
Load delay time: 2 cycles

Instruction Engine
1. Fetch instruction into cache (also ITLB for address translation)
2. Decode instruction, check for interlocks, check cache tag with ITLB Page frame number, and load any operands from registers
3. Execution: ALU computation, compute data virual address L/S, compute branch and virtual address of target
4. Only for non register to register instructions: TLB address translations for data and branch targets
5. Only for non R to R instructions: Cache tag check, check physical address against cache for a miss or hit
6: Write back: (ignores branches), write result to register

Faults and exceptions
Pipeline is interrupted during: Exceptions, Cache Misses, and Data dependencies
Interlocks: Hardware fault handlers such as when cache misses happen
Stall: halt the entire Pipeline
Slip: Advanced part of the pipeline, while other parts are held static
Exceptions: Software based interrupts to pipeline
External Stalls: interlocks that are caused by external components, not affected by pipeline or instruction
At every cycle, interlocks and exception conditions are checked

Timing of exceptions/interlocks: When handling, it takes 4 cycles to evaluate, resolve, buffer the problem
//
Processor will figure out timing optimizations for interlock/exception servicing
   * The processor can backup in the pipeline
   * Service an interlock of an aborted instruction due to an exception

Note: When a fault happens, the instruction is aborted, the servicing begins (at the stage its checked): evaluate, resolve, buffer
List of faults:
----------------------
MultiProcessor stalls occur anytime and not at specific instruction or pipe stages
Instruction TLB Miss: Stall - IS
Instruction Cache Miss: Stall - RF
Coprocessor Possible Exception: Stall - DF
Integer Sign Extend: Stall - DF
Store Interlock: Stall - DF
Data Cache Miss: Stall - TC
Watch Address Exception: Stall - TC
Load Interlock: Slip - RF
Multiply Unit Busy: Slip - RF
Divide Unit Busy: Slip - RF
Multiply / Divide One-Cycle: Slip - RF
Shift greater than 32bits: Slip - RF
FP Busy: Slip - RF
ITLB - Instruction/Data Address: Exception - RF
External Interrupt: Exception - EX
Instruction Bus Error: Exception - EX
IVA Coherent: Exception - EX
Illegal Instruction: Exception - EX
Breakpoint: Exception - EX
Systemcall: Exception - EX
CoProcessor Unusable: Exception - EX
Instruction ECC Error: Exception - EX

Special Cases for performence during fault servicing
Address Acceleration: Bypass the first cache (avoid cache miss fault), send to Secondary cache, uses more energy but saves, can save up to 2 cycles
the subsequent instruction miss address is predicted to be a simple increment of the previous miss address

Uncached Stores: R4000: CPU stalls until the data has been written off chip during WB stage, R4000: this doesn't stall the pipeline

If uncached store is used in a loop, 2 instructions in the branch latency area are killed off.

Memory Mangement Unit (MMU)
Uses TLB cache for translating addresses
All load/stores use virtual addresses
virtual address can map to: TLB cache, cached system bus, uncached system bus

Page frame translations
[V X] w/ Offset -> [P Y] + offset eg: 
a 4K virtual page could map to a 4K page allocated at 0x80000000 (RDRAM)

Cop0 provides a register/instruction based interface for software
TLB can map 96 pages (48 entries of odd/even page pairs)
Cache is checked for matching virtual address extended with ASID
Possible Page size modes (multples of 4): 4K, 16K, 64K, 256K, 1M, 4M, 16M
When an entry is hit, the physical address is computed from (PFN * pagesize) + virtual address
When there is a miss, a TLB refill exception is thrown, to tell the OS to refill or update the cache (selected or random entry)
Duplicate entries can cause TLB to disable itself, TB = 1 in status register of Cop0
Virtual addresses can be 32-bit or 64-bit based on operating mode
TLB Entry: G (global bit), ASID (identifier), VPN (page number for virtual page), offset (offset in page), pfn (page number of physical page)
Hit: G, ASID, VPN input matches an entry, returns PFN value
ASID: 8-bit address space identifier to reduce TLB flushing.  The OS can group entries in the same ASID, so it can safely assume they all exist in the same context without affect performence
When comparing VPNs, first all global marked entries are compared first, then non-globals are compared using ASID.

Translation math based on page size register
Page Size = 2 ^ X
VPN operand size = X
32bit Mode: Offset size = 32 - 8 (asid) - 3 (KSU bits) - X
64bit Mode: Offset size = 64 - 24 (KSU bits and pad) - X

Operating modes
Note: check the upper bits of a virtual address to if 'select' a valid mapped segment (see page 101)
Modes: Kernel, Supervisor, User
When switching operating modes: A context switch is performed
Kernel mode: uses 64-bit addresses
32-bit mode: uses signed 32-bit addresses
64-bit User mode: address bits 63:40 must be 0 else throws Address error exception
Kernel invalid address: using signed 32bit value from user-mode
UX determine 32/64 mode only for User mode, kernel always uses 64bit mode
Operating User Mode: KSU bits = 0b10, EXL = 0, ERL = 0
Operating 64-bit Mode: UX = 1, software uses XTLB, uses XTLB refill exception handlers
Operating 32-bit Mode: UX = 0, software uses TLB, uses TLB refill exception handlers

TLB Virtual Address Composition: VPN (number of bits = 2 ^ X), Offset (number of bits = address size - (2 ^ X))
Convert VPN Mask to Page Size: MASK + 1 = size
Convert back: page size - 1

All page sizes are inheritly multiples of 2, which means in binary, you can evenly mask
out all bits that result a number larger than or equal to the max size of the page (since address starts at 0)
If page size is 4 (0b100), then size - 1 == 0b011, so the highest value within the 2 bits is 3, 0 to 4 is 4 different possible values

TLB Entry Details
VPN2 = VPN / 2, since there is a double amount of available pages in virtual address space due to odd/even PFNs
R = region; 0b00 -> User, 0b01 -> Supervisor, 0b11 -> Kernel
MASK = used to mask out VPN and Offset
G = global; indicates entry must be checked before ASID entries
PFN Even = The even Page frame number, starts at the first half of the page
PFN Odd = the odd page frame number, starts at the second half of the page
PFN -> D = dirty; indicates that the mapped physical page is writeable, else its readonly
PFN -> C = Coherency; controls the cache attribute on the mapped physical page
PFN -> V = Valid: This flag indicates the mapped physical page is valid and usable, else a miss happens

TLB Page Cache attributes
0: Reserved
1: Reserved
2: Uncached
3: Use Cache: Noncoherent - each processor may see different ordered value sequences
4: Use Cache: Exclusive - No value duplicates exist multiple cache levels
5: Use Cache: Exclusive on write (sharable) - only written values are on its own cache level
6: Use Cache: Update on write (update) - 
7: Reserved

TLB Notes: Reading the doc on TLB can be a bit unclear those learning about it froms scratch
* All entries with both even/odd PFN Global bits set to 1, counts as a valid global entry and is checked before ASID specific ones
* ASID of the passed in virtual address comes from EntryHi register, so the operating system must set this up before translation. Used to group process related entries?
* Every entry contains the mask used to extract and compare the VPN in the virtual address
* A virtual address is using an even page if its VPN2 masked by (Mask / 2) results the value of 0
//
* In general the TLB determines how virtual/physical address space is divided up into pages, so that pages can be swapped in and out of physical memory when not being used
  That means each page can be determined by the index: VPN.  The MIPS divides these pages even smaller to allow 2 small pages to fit in one main page
  So a virtual address carries the index of number set: 0 to (MAX_PAGES * 2) - 1, then you divide it by 2 to find the matching entry.  Each entry contains
  the VPN2 index which ranges from 0 to MAX_PAGES - 1. If VPN2 is less than half size of the page, it uses even PFN else odd.  The cache attribute on the entry
  can determine if physical memory access will use the cache or not. If it does use cache, it will indicate the cache line mode such as noncoherent or
  exclusive, etc.  It is important that translation will create an appropiate physical address based on cache attribute, so for example
  uncached TLB entry means base physical address is 0x8000 0000 in order to bypass the cache.  If 0xA000 0000 is used, cache will be accessed, and
  TLB needs to set the cache mode appropiate to the entry desired behavior.
  Note: The N64 doesn't have a real use for TLB because there isn't any available swap memory, a game could use
  TLB for other purposes.
//
* Virtual addresses contain a VPN that is an index of a set where a number is any whole number between 0 and ((VIRTUAL_MEMORY_SIZE / PAGE_SIZE) * 2) - 1
* The size of each odd and even physical page is going to be the size of PAGE_SIZE / 2
* Region Control: When CPU is operating in 32-bit mode, fetch all entries.  When in 64-bit mode, the KSU bits are enabled.
  The entry's KSU bits must match the ones in the status register.

Structure of VPN
32-bit Mode: [KSU (3bits) VPN]
64-bit Mode: [KSU (2 bits) Fill(24bits) VPN]

* TLB / MMU and context switching
* It looks like TLB flushes its cache when changing operating modes on the CPU such as KSU or 32/64 bit mode
  The operating system would have to swap off all existing pages, and flush TLB and cache line.  So each operating mode could use its own
  TLB page mode and cache behavior.
* For N64, I do not see how context switching is possible unless you use a small amount of RAM for switching

TLB Search Algorithm
1. Iterate through all entries in cache (if 32-bit mode) else ones matching KSU bits in status register (TLB shutdown on duplicate matches),
2. Read entry's mask to use for comparing values and extracting the offset in the page
3. if entry is global, go to step 5 if (VAddress.VPN / 2) == ENTRY.VPN2, else go to next step
4. If entry is not global, go to step 5 if EntryHi.ASID == ENTRY.ASID AND (VAddress.VPN / 2) == ENTRY.VPN2, else miss (TLB refill exception thrown)
5. If VPN2 is less than page size / 2, get the even PFN, else get odd PFN
6. If PFN valid bit is 0, then miss else begin address translation

TLB Translation / Load / Store:
1. Determine the base physical address based on cache Coherency bits in PFN
2. If using cache: set cache mode, go to step 4
3. If not using cache: skip to step 4
4. Compute PAddress: P = (Base + (PFN * PageSize)) + Offset
5. If reading: if V = 0, throw TLB Load exception otherwise instruct CPU to fetch data from memory
6. If writing: if V = 0, throw TLB Store exception; if D is set to 1, instruct CPU to write date to memory, else throw TLB store exception;

Match Condition: (VPN / 2) & Mask == VPN2
Some masking math here
32-bit Mode: Offset in page = 32 - 03 - (20 - num bits on in mask)
64-bit Mode: Offset in page = 64 - 26 - (28 - num bits on in mask)
Total Pages: 2 ^ (num bits on)
Another way to compute offset: Page Size in bytes - 1 will equal number of bits in the offset of a virtual address

Virtual Address Compare with TLB Entry (WIP)
1. Get Entry.Mask and lookup page size (shift mask right by 13)
2. Compute offset bit size: page size - 1
3. Shift virtual address to thge right by size of offset
4. Divide VPN by 2 to get VPN2
5. 
  32-bit: (PageMask & Entry.EntryHi) == VPN2
